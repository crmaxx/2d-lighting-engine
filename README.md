# 2d-lighting-engine

A 2D Lighting Engine in C++ using SDL/OpenGL. Creates hard shadows from point lights with any convex polygon you want. A bit old, but I've decided to pick it up again and make it into something real. Very much a WIP, and I would hestitate to call it an engine yet (it doesn't really have any sort of API). It's fun to look at though!

# Dependencies
libSDL2, libSDL2_image, libGL, libGLEW

# Building and running
in the lightingengine/lightingengine/ directory, run `make` and then run `bin/main`

# Example
